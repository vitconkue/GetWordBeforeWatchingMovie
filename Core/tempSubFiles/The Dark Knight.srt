They were trying to buy
the loyalty of tribal leaders...

800

...by bribing them with
precious stones...

801

in a forest north of Rangoon by a bandit.

- Because he thought it was good sport.

808

[BARBARA SCREAMS]

2010
02:20:32,643 --> 02:20:35,479
Dad? Daddy, is he okay?

2011

[BATMAN PANTING]

2012
02:20:51,996 --> 02:20:54,165
- Thank you.
- You don't have to thank me.

2013
02:20:54,790 --> 02:20:56,584
Yes, I do.

2014
02:21:00,838 --> 02:21:02,173
The Joker won.

2015
02:21:04,592 --> 02:21:07,470
Harvey's prosecution,
everything he fought for...

2016
02:21:08,012 --> 02:21:09,763
...undone.

2017
02:21:10,264 --> 02:21:15,186
Whatever chance you gave us at fixing
our city dies with Harvey's reputation.

2018
02:21:15,352 --> 02:21:16,520
We bet it all on him.

2019
02:21:17,855 --> 02:21:20,733
The Joker took the best of us
and tore him down.

2020
02:21:21,317 --> 02:21:22,735
People will lose hope.

2021
02:21:22,902 --> 02:21:24,653
They won't.

2022
02:21:27,156 --> 02:21:29,033
They must never know what he did.

2023
02:21:29,200 --> 02:21:31,035
Five dead.

2024
02:21:31,327 --> 02:21:32,620
Two of them cops.

2025
02:21:32,787 --> 02:21:35,247
- You can't sweep that...
- No.

2026
02:21:40,044 --> 02:21:42,880
But the Joker cannot win.

2027
02:21:48,135 --> 02:21:51,347
Gotham needs its true hero.

2028
02:21:57,728 --> 02:22:00,773
- No.
- You either die a hero...

2029
02:22:00,940 --> 02:22:05,402
...or you live long enough
to see yourself become the villain.

2030
02:22:05,569 --> 02:22:07,404
I can do those things...

2031
02:22:07,822 --> 02:22:10,866
...because I'm not a hero, not like Dent.

2032
02:22:13,869 --> 02:22:16,747
I killed those people.
That's what I can be.

2033
02:22:16,914 --> 02:22:18,833
No, no, you can't. You're not.

2034
02:22:18,999 --> 02:22:21,585
I'm whatever Gotham needs me to be.

2035
02:22:23,254 --> 02:22:24,380
Call it in.

2036
02:22:27,675 --> 02:22:29,426
GORDON:
A hero.

2037
02:22:29,593 --> 02:22:32,847
Not the hero we deserved,
but the hero we needed.

2038
02:22:33,430 --> 02:22:35,975
Nothing less than a knight...

2039
02:22:36,517 --> 02:22:38,227
...shining.

2040
02:22:38,853 --> 02:22:40,479
<i>GORDON:
They'll hunt you.</i>

2041
02:22:40,646 --> 02:22:42,439
<i>BATMAN:
You'll hunt me.</i>

2042
02:22:42,940 --> 02:22:44,900
<i>You'll condemn me.</i>

2043
02:22:45,609 --> 02:22:47,903
<i>Set the dogs on me.</i>

2044
02:22:51,657 --> 02:22:53,951
<i>Because that's what needs to happen.</i>

2045
02:22:55,119 --> 02:22:57,037
<i>Because sometimes...</i>

2046
02:22:57,204 --> 02:22:59,373
<i>... the truth isn 't good enough.</i>

2047
02:23:00,249 --> 02:23:02,543
<i>Sometimes people deserve more.</i>

2048
02:23:06,005 --> 02:23:09,925
<i>Sometimes people deserve
to have their faith rewarded.</i>

2049
02:23:10,092 --> 02:23:12,428
[ELECTRICITY CRACKLING]

2050
02:23:28,319 --> 02:23:29,987
JAMES:
Batman.

2051
02:23:31,906 --> 02:23:33,657
Batman!

2052
02:23:34,450 --> 02:23:36,410
Why's he running, Dad?

2053
02:23:37,453 --> 02:23:38,788
Because we have to chase him.

2054
02:23:38,954 --> 02:23:41,832
Okay, we're going in! Go, go! Move!

2055
02:23:47,922 --> 02:23:49,507
He didn't do anything wrong.

2056
02:23:49,673 --> 02:23:51,675
[BARKING]

2057
02:23:52,259 --> 02:23:57,848
Because he's the hero Gotham deserves,
but not the one it needs right now.

2058
02:23:59,266 --> 02:24:00,309
<i>So we'll hunt him...</i>

2059
02:24:03,437 --> 02:24:05,523
<i>... because he can take it.</i>

2060
02:24:08,025 --> 02:24:10,528
<i>Because he's not our hero.</i>

2061
02:24:18,077 --> 02:24:19,286
<i>He's a silent guardian...</i>

2062
02:24:20,454 --> 02:24:22,331
...a watchful protector.

2063
02:24:24,834 --> 02:24:26,127
<i>A dark knight.</i>

2064
02:24:27,305 --> 02:25:27,756
